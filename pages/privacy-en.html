        <h2>Fundamentals</h2>

        <p>This Privacy Policy is intended to inform the users of this website about the nature, scope and purpose of
            the collection and use of personal data by the website operator of {{ site.url }}.</p>

        <p>The website operator takes your privacy very seriously and will treat your personal information
            confidentially and in accordance with the law. As new technologies and the continuous development of this
            website may make changes to this privacy policy, we recommend that you review the privacy policy at regular
            intervals.</p>

        <p>Definitions of the terms used (e.g. "personal data" or "processing") can be found in Art. 4 GDPR.</p>

        <p>You can visit this website without giving any personal information. However, in order to improve our online
            offer and for security reasons, we store (without personal reference) your access data to this website.
            These access data include e.g. the files you requested or the name of your Internet service provider. Due to
            the anonymization of the data, conclusions about your person are not possible.</p>

        <h2>Access data</h2>

        <p>We, the website operator or our processor and site provider, the STRATO AG, collect data on access to the
            website based on our legitimate interest (see Art. 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR) and save it as "server log files" on
            the server of the website. The following data is logged:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Visited website</li>
            <li>Time of access</li>
            <li>Amount of data sent in bytes</li>
            <li>Source / reference from which you came to the page</li>
            <li>Browser used</li>
            <li>Operating system used</li>
            <li>Used IP address</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The site provider stores the IP addresses for 7 days in the server log files.
            The storage of the data is done for security reasons e.g. to clarify cases of abuse. By means of the
            information stored in these log files, identification of the user without additional information is not
            possible.
        </p>
        <p> After 7 days, the IP addresses will be irrevocably anonymized by the site provider. After that, an
            identification of the user is no longer possible by additional information. The further storage of these
            anonymized log files takes place for the maximum duration of the website's existence and serves exclusively
            statistical purposes and the administration and optimization of the website.</p>

        <p>If data must be revoked for reasons of proof, they are excluded from the deletion until the incident has been
            definitively clarified.</p>

        <p>Only the page provider has access to the non-anonymized IP address of the user for 7 days. We, the website
            operator, on the other hand, never have access to the non-anonymized IP address of the user. Therefore, it
            is never possible for us to identify the user. According to Art. 11 para. 2 GDPR, the following user's
            rights do not apply to the access data and can not be executed by the website operator because we can not
            identify the user: right of access, right to rectification, right to erasure, right to restriction of
            processing, right to data portability (Art.15 to Art. 20 GPDR).</p>

        <h2>Handling of contact information</h2>

        <p>If you contact us, the website operator, through the offered contact options, your details will be stored for
            the duration of the communication, so that they can be used to process and answer your request. This data
            will not be disclosed to third parties.</p>

        <h2>Rights of the user</h2>

        <p>As a user, you have the right to receive, on request, free information about which personal data has been
            stored about you. You also have the right to correct incorrect data and to restrict or delete your personal
            data. If applicable, you can also claim your right to data portability. If you believe your data has been
            processed unlawfully, you can file a complaint with the appropriate regulatory agency.</p>

        <h3>Deletion of data</h3>

        <p>If your request does not conflict with a legal obligation to store data (e.g. data retention), you are
            entitled to delete your data. Data stored by us, if they are no longer necessary for their purpose and there
            are no legal retention periods, will be deleted. If deletion can not be carried out because the data is
            required for legal purposes, data processing is restricted. In this case, the data is locked and not
            processed for other purposes.</p>

        <h3>Right to object</h3>

        <p>Users of this website can exercise their right of objection and object to the processing of their personal
            data at any time.</p>

        <p>If you would like a correction, blocking, deletion or information about the personal data stored about you,
            or if you have questions regarding the collection, processing or use of your personal data or if you wish to
            revoke your consent, please contact us via the following e-mail address: {{ site.email }}</p>
