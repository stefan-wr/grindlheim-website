    - A tunnel carved from the solid rocky mountains that surround Grindlheim leads into the theme world.
    - The entrance plaza is the first area of Grindlheim that guests set foot on when they enter the theme world.
    - Step through the gate on the right and you find yourself on the circular footpath surrounding Grindlheim. This way leads through the K'aros Roasthouse up to the entrance of Ri'kh located on the other side of the village.
    - The entrance to K'aros lies in the middle on the opposite site of the plaza. The building with the crane tower houses staff- and guest facilities as well as an ice cream shop.
    - The left side of the plaza is where the cosy little restaurant Schmausestube is based.
    - The seating area of the restaurant lies behind this detailed facade.
    - No town square is complete without a little fountain. I also used it to hide an ugly gap in the path which I was not able to get rid of.
    - This is the front facade and the main entrance to the restaurant. Guests can walk all around the restaurant using the path to the left.
    - On the far left corner of the plaza and on the right side of the facade, the circular footpath reconnects to the plaza. This way also leads to Ri'kh.
    - These facades hide the staff entrance to the restaurant.
    - Up this path and to the right guests can get very close to the first launch of K'aros.
    - A second entrance to the restauraunt is located on the backside together with an additional outdoor seating area on the left.
    - These facades at the boundary of the theme world decorate the path on the back of the restaurant.
    - Topdown view onto the restaurant and the cosy outdoor seating area. A glass roof panel allows the inside of the restaurant to be lit by real sun light.
    - We are now inside the restaurant. The curved wooden ceiling structure is the building's dominant feature. The f   ood stalls are located on the right.
    - The seating area provides separated tables and plenty of space for all guests.
    - And here is the last picture for today. There is not much left for me to show you before I release the park on the workshop. Stay tuned and please stay patient!

    Welcome back for another update! It's been two long months since the last one, but today I finally found some time for the next one.
    Last time we followed the first track section of Ri'kh, the family coaster.
    For today's update we focus mainly on theming and return to the entrance plaza of Grindlheim.
</p>

<p class="gr-medium">
    There's only one path leading in and out of Grindlheim. It connects to a plaza, the place where guests first enter into the immersive theme world.
    As mentioned and partially shown in previous updates, the entrance to the queue line of K'aros is located here, as well as other facilities and a restaurant.
    I started planning and laying out this area of Grindlheim very early on in the project.
    Though the facilities and queue buildings of K'aros were among the first ones to be erected, the rest of the plaza was left unfinished till the very end.
    The restaurant I mentioned before was the last and final build in the whole project.

<p class="gr-medium">
    I did not like the idea of the restaurant being a black box that guests just disappear in.
    Therefore, to create a realistic restaurant with guests sitting on real tables inside the building, I did not make use of the in-game restaurant system but went for a self-service approach with standard food stalls and a seating area instead.
    This allowed me to theme the inside of the restaurant as well. The finished restaurant is called "Schmausestube", which loosely translates to "a cosy place to eat".
