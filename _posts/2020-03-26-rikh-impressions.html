image-descriptions:
    - This shot was taken inside the station of Ri'kh. Guests are waiting for the gates to open so they can finally enter the car. I can assure you that hard hats are not required for this ride, the clearance profile was adhered to.
    - Due to the limited space inside K'aros' track layout where the station is located, it is only single sided with both the exit and entrance situated on the right side.
    - The first part of Ri'kh is the lift hill. It goes straight through and up this tower.
    - K'aros crosses this tower two times as well right underneath Ri'kh's lift hill. The angled wooden boards on the top left border of this picture indicate the direction of the lift hill.
    - There was not much room to separate K'aros and Ri'kh inside the tower, hence the weird angles and compliacted wooden structures that I  built out of individual boards.
    - Ri'kh leaves the tower at the top of the lift hill.
    - A 180 degree downward curve follows.
    - This is the view at the top of the lift hill. The queue line is located right beneath this section as shown in the previous blog update.
    - On this bird's eye view you can see the circular footpath that surrounds Grindlheim on the right. 
    - Next, the track leads through another part of the building before it goes down the big drop.
    - Clearance is tight but whenever a coaster crosses a building I make sure that the car itself and guests are safe and collisions are not possible.
    - At this point the car has alraeady built up some speed and whizzes through this tight corridor.
    - And down it goes the drop. Here you can also see the little herb and flower garden of Grindlheim.

    Welcome back for another update on Grindlheim. Let's start off with some good news first:
</p>

<p class="gr-large bold">
Work on Grindlheim has been completed! It is done!
</p>

<p class="gr-medium">
    I had a very productive phase over the last weeks and was able to finish the remaining unthemed parts of Grindlheim much quicker than I anticipated.
    In particular, I created the main restaurant of Grindlheim next to the entrance to K'aros and I finished theming the entrance area of Grindlheim itself.
    This does not mean that I am done with the project though. I still want to create music for the coasters and the theme world and I also want to make a video of course.
    This will take some more time and I will release Grindlheim to the workshop when the project as a whole is done.
    Till then you can expect some more updates to be released on my blog here.
</p>

<p class="gr-medium">
    Nevertheless I already released a collection of useful objects and sets from Grindlheim on the workshop. Please check them out via the link below, they might be useful for your creations as well.

    But let's get back to the topic of today which is Ri'kh, the family coaster. In the last update I showed you the complete queue line and today we continue with the station and the first section of track.
    The station of Ri'kh is situated in the middle of Grindlheim and is surrounded by the tracks of K'aros. Due to the space limitians it is only a single sided station, but throughput is not mitigated by that.
</p>

<p class="gr-medium">
    When the coaster car leaves the station it immediatly encounters the lift hill which is partly enclosed by a big tower which itself is part of the Ri'kh queue building.
    Right under the lift hill K'aros passes through the same tower two times as well.
    I built complicated skewed wooden corridors out of individual boards to separate the tracks of K'ars and Ri'kh from each other while they pass through the building.
    You can see the result on pictures 3 to 6.
</p>

<p class="gr-medium">
    Now, please check out the gallery below to continue following the first track-section of Ri'kh.
