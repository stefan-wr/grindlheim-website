title: K'aros Roast House Pt. 1
excerpt: "Grindlheim is built with a circular path surrounding the complete theme world with the two coasters located in the center.
In today's blog post we have a closer look at the first section of this footpath which leads right through the K'aros coffee roast house."

image-descriptions:
    - A circular path surrounds the theme world. This part of the path branches from the entrance plaza and leads to the entrance of Ri'kh.
    - On the other side of these facades lies the K'aros entrance plaza.
    - You can get there through this building which houses bathrooms and lockers.
    - The circular path continues up the stairs and through the K'aros roast house which is powered by this waterwheel on the left.
    - Another path is branching off here. The stairs on the left lead up to the observation deck and a coffee shop.
    - This is a bird's view of the complete area.
    - This storage tower is part of the roast house. Its cranes are powered by the waterwheel.
    - The roasters inside the house are also powered by the waterwheel.
    - At the bottom of the storage tower, the motion of the waterwheel is transported to the cranes via these cogs.
    - A more complex set of cogs in the roast house's roof structure transports the power to the roasters.
    - The circular path leads guests right through the roast house and underneath this intimidating machine.
    - I made sure that all cogs are properly connected and serve a purpose.
    - In the next update we continue here and have a better look and the surroundings and the observation deck.

    While the last three blog posts followed the ride experience of K'aros, today, we focus more on the theming and
    check out the first section of the circular footpath that surrounds Grindlheim and the two coasters.
    While the queue to K'aros lies near the entrance of the theme world, the exit of K'aros and entrance if Ri'kh are located on the other side of the Grindlheim.
    The circular footpath connects these locations and therefore is much-frequented. My goal is that walking along the footpath is an experience on its own due to heavy theming.

    One special theming element along the path is the K'aros coffee roast house, where the beans for the coffee shop on the observation deck seem to be produced.
    Following the theme of Grindlheim, the roast house is not powered by electricity but by a waterwheel at the side of the building.
    The circular motion of the wheel is transported via a complex set of cogs and powers the roasters.
    Guests walk right through the roast house and can experience the rattle, roars and vibrations of this large machine first hand.
