    - We start by exiting the K'aros roast house and follow the path that will lead us to the entrance to Ri'kh on the other side of Grindlheim.
    - Here, the path clinges closely to the near-vertical mountain cliff on the right.
    - The stone pillar structures were built to support the mountain and the caves that lie beneath.
    - Some Grindlheimers have built their home in this more secluded area...
    - ...right on the cliff side.
    - The Grindlheim theme world features 360° theming, which means guests are fully immersed in it, whatever direction they look.
    - The roofed bridge on the bottom is connected to the exit of K'aros. This is the area where guests exit back on to the path after riding K'aros.
    - Here, brave guests can rest on the benches on the left after they rode K'aros...
    - ...or they can refresh themselves with some fruity juice from this store on the right.
    - There are also restrooms hidden inside the cliffs on the left.
    - This image shows the section of path we just followed. Next time we continue to follow the path on the right.

    Welcome back to the blog to today's update which is a just a small one.
    We contiue to focus once more on the circular footpath surrounding Grindlheim.
    This will eventually lead us to the entrance to Ri'kh, the second and family focused coaster in Grindlheim.
    We start following this path were we left off last time, at the K'aros roast house.
</p>

<p class="gr-medium">
    Though there is no big theming element waiting for us to explore on this next section of the path,
    the general 360° theming that is present everywhere in Grindlheim is still worth to look at.
    We also come by the area where the exit of K'aros connects back to the main footpath.
</p>

<p class="gr-medium">
    Next time I will start to show the first images of the queue building for Ri'kh which I am very proud of.
    So don't forget to come back for those. Also, I made very good progress and started to theme the most complicated part of track of K'aros.
    More and more elements of Grindlheim are coming together nicely at the moment.

    Now, please check out the gallery below and follow along the path through Grindlheim.
