    - The train leaves the station...
    - ...and slowly meanders down the first section of track leading up to the first launch.
    - Here K'aros crosses over Ri'kh before entering the launch building.
    - We are coming close to the launch now.
    - Just one more curve through this themed room.
    - As the train is slowed down on the straight launch section, the machine's pistons and gears start to move.
    - This is what the start of the launch section looks fom the outside. Underneath the launch lies the queue line of K'aros. Above, people can have a cup of coffee on the observation deck, but more of that in a later update.
    - As the train slowly moves forward, the steam and sound effects start to play as well.
    - Close to the launch the effects intensify and the machine starts to crack and rumble.
    - And finally, the train is shot out of the launch building with a big blast of smoke.
    - On the left side a path runs parallel to the launch so people can feel the power of the coaster when standing right next to it.
    - The journey through Grindlheim begins.

    In the last two blog posts we had a look at the queue line and station building of K'aros.
    Today we follow the K'aros experience by taking a seat in the coaster and checking out its
    first section starting at the station and leading up to the first launch.

    As ususal with Grindlheim, inspiration of this section was taken from Taron at Phantasialand.
    The coaster slowly leaves the station and makes its way around the first corners until it stops on the launch track.
    A synchronized soundtrack is being played throughout this part to raise the suspense before the sudden launch.
    I'm doing the same with K'aros but I added some extra effects. In Grindlheim the launches of K'aros are being
    powered by a huge steam machine located in the queue line. Right before the launch, dozens of triggered steam and sound effects
    raise the suspense even further. Getting all the effects to work was not an easy task because I ran into issues with the game not triggering some of them properly.
