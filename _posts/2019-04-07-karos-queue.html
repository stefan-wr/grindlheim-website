    - You may know these buildings from the last blog post. This is the main plaza where the queue line of K'aros begins.
    - The center of the first room that guests enter is themed with a huge machine that powers the launches of the coaster.
    - Moving parts like cogs and pistons and timed steam effects are part of this structure.
    - After the machien room the queue takes a 180Â° turn. This is located inside the tower-like building on the left of picture \#1.
    - Guests can take a last look onto the plaza before the queue leads further down inside the building.
    - The open windows of the following passage reveal the coaster and its large station building for the first time. K'aros' first launch is directly located above this section.
    - The passage is also parallel to the second launch of K'aros so that guests have an incredible view of the coaster rushing by. Next, the queue crosses over the launch via the little roofed bridge that can be seen on the left.
    - Following the bridge, crossing over K'aros and Ri'kh, guests then enter the basement of the station building...
    - ...which is home to the only small 'cattle pen' like line on K'aros' queue. The boarding station is located directly above this room.
    - Up next, the queue leaves the basement and hugs the outside wall of the station. The path leads up the stairs on the left.
    - The stairs curve to right following the station's wall up to the highest point of the queue while crossing K'aros again below and above.
    - Missing out on K'aros means missing out on incredible views of Grindlheim that can only be enjoyed from the queue line. We are close the end now.
    - One last turn right and a few steps done and we finally enter the station.
    - Marked in orange on this bird's eye view is the complete queue line. Most of it is hidden inside buildings and deeply integrated into the overall theming.

    Welcome back to the second post here on the Grindlheim blog.<br>
    Today I want to show you the complete queue line of K'aros.
</p>

<p class="gr-medium">
    For heavily themed coasters like K'aros, standing in line for the ride is an integral part of the experience.
    Usually more time is spent in the queue than on the ride itself.
    Therefore an interesting queue layout and good theming are important to built up excitement for the ride.
</p>

<p class="gr-medium">
    Like at Klugheim at Phantasialand, I decided to not integrate pre-shows into my queues but try to make them interesting by layout, architecture, theming and music.
    While I'm currently making good progress on the queue for Ri'kh, K'aros' queue line is already finished and ready to be shown to you.
    As you might understand after viewing the 14 images I brought along for today, building K'aros' queue and theming it was not an easy task because
    most of it is hidden inside multi-story buildings. Furthermore, elevated sections cross the coasters K'aros and Ri'kh several times.
    I was struggling especially with theming curved stairs which I'm trying to avoid from now on.
