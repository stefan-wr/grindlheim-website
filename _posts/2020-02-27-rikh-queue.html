title: The Queue Line of Ri'kh
excerpt: "In the previous posts we followed the circular footpath from the entrance of K’aros to the opposite side of the area where the entrance to Ri’kh, the smaller, family friendly coaster of the two is situated. This time we continue and check out its complete, fully themed queue line."

    - We ended the last update right here, at the entrance to the queue line of Ri'kh. Today we take a walk along the complete queue line and descend down to Ri'kh's station.
    - Like K'aro's queue, the queue line of Ri'kh is fully themed inside and out. First, guests pass through this small corridor before entering a small inner courtyard.
    - The courtyard can not be accessed or seen from outside the queue. Only the guests waiting in line can experience the theming here.
    - Ri'kh's first section of track after the lift hill runs right across and over the courtyard.
    - The big tower houses the upper half of the lift hill of Ri'kh and is probably the biggest building in Grindlheim.
    - Another view down into the courtyard. The footpath surrounding Grindlheim is located on the right.
    - Now, guests pass the corridor again and follow the queue deeper into the building.
    - Only the Grindlheimers know what exactly all these pulleys, ropes and counter weights control.
    - Next, guests enter a large room with a big stair leading down and out of the building. In case of an emergency, guests can leave the queue through the rounded stairs on the left. We saw this door from the other side in the last update.
    - This room was the most complicated build of the queue and is the most detailed one, too.
    - 
    - After this room, the queue leaves the building for a few meters and allows guests to get some great views of the coasters before it continues back into the building.
    - And this is how the queue building looks from the outside. Not only does the big tower house Ri'kh's lift hill, K'aros crosses through it two times as well.
    - After entering the building, the queue makes a turn to the left and down some stairs again. The big window on the left of the queue allows more great views of K'aros rushing by.
    - What follows is the basement of the building where the queue makes a 180 degree turn around another set of these mysterious counter weights.
    -
    - Next, the queue leaves the basement through this tight corridor.
    - Here, guests can catch some sun light here before they finally enter the station building of Ri'kh.
    -
    - Just one more corridor...
    - ...and we finally arrive at the entrance to the station of Ri'kh.
    - Last but not least, I marked of the course of the complete queue line on this overview. Though it is quite long, the overall space it occupies is relatively small.

    It is time for an update again and this time, and probably in the next updates as well,
    we focus our attention on Ri'kh, the smaller, family friendlier one of the two roller coasters in Grindlheim.
    In the previous updates we took the long way along the footpath surrounding Grindlheim from K'aros' entrance all
    the way to the entrance of Ri'kh, where we left off last time. Today, we continue and walk along the complete,
    fully themed queue line of Ri'kh.
</p>
<p class="gr-medium">
    Like the queue of K’aros which I have already shown in a previous blog post
    (<a href="{{ site.posts[-2].url }}" >{{ site.posts[-2].title }}</a>),
    Ri’kh’s queue is themed from the inside and out. Every point that can be reached and viewed from a guest's perspective
    is supposed to be fully themed and to not break the immersion.
</p>
<p class="gr-medium">
    Most of the queue is located inside the largest contiguous building of Grindlheim.
    Though it is quite a long queue, it occupies a relatively small amount of space without using the typical but boring “cattle-pen” style layout.
    This is only possible because it stretches over multiple stories and makes good use of the available space.
    For example, most of the queue building is not just an empty shell. Even Ri’kh itself and K'aros cross the building several times.
    Though this made constructing the building more difficult than ususal, I am very happy with the result and I think that Ri'kh's queue turned out better than K'aros'.

    Also have a look at the last image in particular for an overview shot with the course of the queue highlighted.
