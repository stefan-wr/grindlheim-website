image-descriptions:
- This is a bird's-eye view of Grindlheim in its current state. As you can see, I haven't started on the most complicated theming job, the entwined track of K'aros on the left. The east side of Grindlheim is mostly finished.
- Here you can see where the stations and entrances of K'aros and Ri'kh are located within Grindlheim. Guests will enter the theme world at the bottom of the image at K'aros' entrance.
- An image of K'aros and the logo I designed for the coaster.
- The middle of the image shows the station and brake run of K'aros. I will show the complete station in a later update.
- This is the entrance of K'aros' queue line. Of course the complete queue is heavily themed. I will show it in a later update.
- The same building from a different angle.
- This is the family coaster Ri'kh. Inspired by how Klugheim at Phantasialand was designed, most of Ri'kh's track lies below normal ground level. What do you think of the logo? Leave a comment on Reddit or the Planet Coaster Forums (links at the top)!

    Welcome to the Grindlheim Blog, dear Planet Coaster friends and enthusiasts. I'm pleased you found your way onto this
    site and my project blog. This is the very first post here, so please stick around and let me explain to you what
    Grindlheim is, what I'm building here and what is planned.
</p>
<p class="gr-medium">
    At first I'd like to introduce you the project: Grindlheim is an immersive Planet Coaster theme world that I
    started building at the end of 2016. At that time I visited the amazing Klugheim at Phantasialand in Germany and
    since then I wanted to create something similar within Planet Coaster which was just released at that time. But
    during the second half of 2017 and till summer 2018 I spent most of the time in Planet Coaster with building <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WpCuqCUu-w">VOLT, a
    launch coaster inspired by HELIX at Liseberg.</a>
</p>
<p class="gr-medium">
    But since then I was back dedicating all my Planet Coaster time on Grindlheim. If I have to guess I'd say I already
    spent 400 - 500 hours into this project and I'm not close to finishing. But I have enough in stock now to finally
    show you what I'm working on. Like Klugheim, Grindlheim has two rollercoasters: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.data.urls.karos }}">K'aros</a>, a fast multi launch coaster
    and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.data.urls.rikh }}">Ri'kh</a>, a family coaster. You can check out their dedicated pages on this site for some more information, stats and a
    few images. But there are many more details, information and images to come in the future.
</p>
<p class="gr-medium">
    I created this blog to beautifully present the project in an organized and chronological order. Nevertheless I will
    still post every update on <a href="{{ site.data.urls.reddit-profile }}">Reddit</a>, or on the <a href="{{ site.data.urls.planco-forums }}">Planet Coaster Forums</a> so you can comment and discuss the progress or
    suggest improvements. Every blog post will consist of text and a gallery below. Some images will have descriptions
    that you can toggle on and off with the eye-symbol in the gallery controls.
</p>
<p class="gr-medium">
    That's it for now. Please check out the images below and come back for the next update.<br>
