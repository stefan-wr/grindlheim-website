title: The Station of K'aros
excerpt: "Last time I showed you the complete queue line of K'aros from the entrance to the station.
In this post we continue and not only take a look inside the station of K'aros but also look at the exterior of the station building from various angles."

    - "We start our overview of the station where we ended the last post: At the last part of the queue line where it enters the station."
    - And this is how the station looks from the inside. Like everything in Grindlheim it is completely themed from the roof to the ceiling.
    - Guests enter the train from its right side. The stations's exit is located on the left of the track.
    - K'aros' train has 9 rows and can fit up to 18 passengers.
    - I finished this station nearly two years ago. Did I mention I'm working on this project for a long time now?
    - Here you can see the operator's room on the right side of the picture. There are shelfs for bags on the left side of the track near the exit.
    - Now we take a look at the exterior of the station building.
    - The station is surrounded by the tracks of K'aros and Ri'kh on multiple levels.
    - Here, a train is leaving the station and slowly making its way to the first launch.
    - The little roofed bridge on the left leads from the exit of the coaster back to the main path. On the right side a train is waiting in the final break run to enter the station.
    - The same side of the building from a guest's perspective.
    - And this final picture completes today's tour in and around the station building. See you next time!

    Welcome back for the third post here on the Grindlheim blog.<br>
    Last time I showed you the queue line of K'aros up to the point where guests finally enter the station building before taking a seat in the coaster.
    In todays post we continue from this point and take a look in and around the station of K'aros.

    It's been a while since the last blog post. Much longer than I intended, I have to admit.
    I planned to release updates every two weeks or at least once per month but it just didn't work out during the last two months.
    Nevertheless, I continued working on Ri'kh's queue line and made very good progress, so much that it is completed.
    I hope that I will be able to update the blog a bit quicker next time. I still have a lot to show to you.
