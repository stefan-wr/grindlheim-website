<p class="gr-medium">
    With the previous updates, I already presented you the main key-areas of Grindlheim.
    But there are still some smaller areas and buildings left that you have not seen yet.
    With today's update, I want to show you some of those areas and also present some new perspectives.
    That's why for today, I only brought along a set of assorted images. Please check out the gallery below to view them.
    That's basically it for today. Please stay patient for a bit longer for the final video and the workshop release .
