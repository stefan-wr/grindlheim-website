    - Last time we left off at the left side of this bridge.
    - It crosses over the path that leads from the exit of Ri'kh back up to main path on ground level.
    - The path also leads right through this building before it connects back to the main path.
    - This is the view from this path.
    - On the left of this picture you can see the continuation of the rocky cliff sides you saw in the last update.
    - Because Ri'kh's station on the top left of this image lies below normal ground level, guests need to climb a set of stairs back to the main path.
    - And this is the view of the bridge they have while doing so.
    - K'aros crosses over the station of Ri'kh several times. On the left you can get a first look of the queue building of Ri'kh.
    -
    - This is on the other side of the bridge. On the left, the path from Ri'kh's exit connects back to the main path.
    - We turn to the right and see the facades of the queue building on the entrance plaza. The lattice door serves as an emergency exit of the queue line of Ri'kh.
    - And here it is, the entrance to the queue line. Can you spot the piece of Ri'kh's track in this image?
    -
    - That's it for today. Please come back next time for a complete tour of the long and detailed queue line.

    For the last three updates we followed the circular footpath that surrounds Grindlheim and checked out all the details along the path.
    For the first update in the new year of 2020 - happy new year to you all - we continue this trend once more.
    Today we will finally arrive at the other side of Grindlheim at the entrance to the queue line of Ri'kh, the family coaster of Grindlheim.
</p>

<p class="gr-medium">
    We start were we left off last time by crossing a bridge that leads to the entrance plaza of Ri'kh.
    It crosses over another path that connects the exit of Ri'kh back to the main path at ground level.
    Then we enter the entrance plaza of Ri'kh and check out the datailed facade of Ri'kh's queue building.
</p>

<p class="gr-medium">
    Once finished, the entrance plaza will be completely surrounded by facades and buildings and will represent an immersive town square.
    But till now, only one side is finished. In the next update we will be entering the detailed queue line of Ri'kh.
